The scene: day one of a consulting gig with a new client to build a design and code library for a web app. As luck would have it, the client invited me to sit in on a summit of 25 design leaders from across their enterprise planning across platforms and lines of business. The company had just exploded from 30 to over 100 designers. Hundreds more were coming. Divergent product design was everywhere. They dug in to align efforts.
